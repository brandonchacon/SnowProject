## Overview

This Java application displays a random assortment of white snowflakes with features based on a very
simple code that repeats itself.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
no code required to start the project
```

The whole code is active until you close the page or refresh the page to reset the snowflakes.

## Discussion

When starting the project i had no clue how get a snowflake that is created on the screen and put 
it in a array for the other function to change or manipulate it to move. So first I made a function that will grab 
the snowflake() function and added parameters to set the location of the snowflake and also added a for loop around
it to make it repeat 100 times. Then grabed the snow() function that contained the for loop function snowflake() and 
put it in drawsnow() with myvar variable outside the function in order to add the set interval code and made it repeat 
forever in set time. And added a canvas before this to display the white snowflake with a light blue background.


## Extra Credit

Made the code repeat in set intervals
